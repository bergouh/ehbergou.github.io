Currently I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at [UM6P](https://www.um6p.ma/en). Between 2018 and 2020, I was a research scientist at  KAUST, Thuwal, KSA. Between 2015 and 2017 I was a resercher scientist at INRAE, Jouy en Josas, France. I did my PhD at INPT, Toulouse, France, under the supervision of [Serge Gratton](http://gratton.perso.enseeiht.fr/) in Algo team where I worked on numerical methods for least squares, non convex optimization and data assimilation. I received a Master's degree in 2011 from ENSTA ParisTech and Paris 1, where I studied Applied maths for finance.
