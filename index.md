I am El houcine Bergou, a postdoctoral fellow at KAUST, Saudi Arabia, hosted. I did my PhD at INPT, France, under the supervision of [Serge Gratton](https://bianchi.wp.imt.fr/), in the algo team. I work on stochastic approximation, optimization and machine learning. I received the Masters degrees in 2011 from ENSTA ParisTech, where I studied statistics, and from Paris 1 University, where I studied advanced probability. Here is my CV ([english]({{site.baseurl}}{% link postdoc_en.pdf %}) or [french]({{site.baseurl}}{% link postdoc_fr.pdf %})).
