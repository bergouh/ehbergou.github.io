# I am a researcher in the MaIAGE team at INRA in Jouy-en-Josas, France. 
Currently I am a research scientist at  KAUST, Thuwal, KSA (on leave from INRAE, France). I did my PhD at INPT, Toulouse, France, under the supervision of [Serge Gratton](http://gratton.perso.enseeiht.fr/) in Algo team where I worked on numerical methods for least squares, non convex optimization and data assimilation. I received a Master's degree in 2011 from ENSTA ParisTech and Paris 1, where I studied Applied maths for finance.
