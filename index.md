I am El houcine Bergou, a researcher at INRA. Curently I am on leave at KAUST, Saudi Arabia. I did my PhD at INPT, France, under the supervision of [Serge Gratton](https://bianchi.wp.imt.fr/), in the algo team. I work on stochastic approximation, optimization and machine learning. I received the Masters degrees in 2011 from ENSTA ParisTech and Paris 1 University, where I studied statistics, advanced probability and numerical optimization. Here is my CV {{site.baseurl}}{% link postdoc_en.pdf %}.
